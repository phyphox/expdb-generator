<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this experiment, you drop a ball near the microphone of your phone
onto a hard surface (i.e. a table). Phyphox will detect the sounds of
each impact of the ball on the surface and use their timing to determine
the drop height of the ball. It will show the maxima of its free fall
parabola between each impact as well as the kinetic energy retained
after each impact (relative to the initial energy).</p>
<h3 id="topics-covered">Topics covered</h3>
<p>This experiment can be used to discuss conservation of energy and in
particular potential and kinetic energy. It can also be used as a tool
to discuss and explore elastic/plastic/inelastic collisions. Finally,
since a parabolic trajectory is assumed, it can also be used in context
of a simple parabolic free fall by looking at the maximum estimate
between each impact. However, understanding the entire data presented by
phyphox requires some understanding of energy.</p>
<h3 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Smartphone or tablet with phyphox</li>
<li>Ball (small metal ball, golf ball, …)</li>
<li>Hard surface (table)</li>
<li>Tape measure or similar if you want to verify phyphox results</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-effort">Time effort</h3>
<p>The experiment can be set up within a minute. However, depending on
the noise level of the surroundings, it can take a few tries to fine
tune the threshold (sensitivity) of the trigger (see problems and
solutions below).</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Place your phone on the surface or a stand close to the surface. As
you want to detect the sound from the ball’s impact on the surface, it
is highly recommended to be as close to the impact point as possible, so
the sound stands out from background noises in the room.</p>
<p>In phyphox select the configuration “(In)elastic collision” from the
main menu. Press the triangle in the top-right corner to start the
measurement.</p>
<p>Depending on the noise in your room, your choice of ball and surface
and your phone model, you might have to adjust the “threshold” setting
in the “Settings” tab. This determines at which volume (on a scale from
zero to one) noise is considered as an event in the experiment. If
measurements are coming in on the “Heights” or “Energy” tab immediately
without a bouncing ball, you want to increase the threshold from its
default value of 0.1. If you do not get any measurements when the ball
is bouncing, you might want to decrease it.</p>
<p>Minimum delay determines how long phyphox will wait after an event
before considering sound above the threshold as a new event. This can be
increased if a single impact is counted multiple times due to
reverbaration, but the first measure should be to increase the
threshold. For most experiments, the default of 0.1s should be fine.</p>
<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>
<p>Make sure phyphox is running (top-right corner shows a pause symbol
instead of the triangular start button). Reset your measurements by
pressing the “reset” button the “heights” or “energy” tab. Drop the ball
next to the phones microphone. Optionally you can hold a tape measure
next to the dropping ball for reference.</p>
<p>The Heights tab will show up to five time intervals that correspond
to six impacts on your surface.</p>
<h2 id="data-analysis">Data analysis</h2>
<p>The times shown in the “heights” tab correspond to the time
difference between two impacts on the table. The heights 1 to 5
correspond to the maximum height that the ball reached during the
corresponding time interval. Height 0 is the initial height
<strong>before</strong> the first impact, extrapolated from impacts 1 to
3 (see Physics background and analysis details).</p>
<p>The energy tab shows energy data corresponding to the heights that
have actually been derived from time intervals. As there is no means to
determine the absolute energy the energy of height 1 is set to 100%,
meaning that all energy is expressed as a fraction of the potential
energy of height 1 from the “heights” tab. Consequentially, Energy 2 to
5 correspond to the potential energy of height 2 to 5 and therefore the
ratio of height 2 to 5 and height 1. The smaller entries “Retained on
collision” is just the ratio of the potential enery of the current time
interval divided by the potential enery of the previous interval,
thereby representing the fraction of energy that was retained as kinetic
energy after the last bounce.</p>
<h2 id="physics-background-and-analysis-details">Physics background and
analysis details</h2>
<p>Phyphox records audio samples from the phone’s microphone and
considers them sequentially (like the “acoustic stopwatch”
configuration). The samples are normalized to a range of -1 to 1,
although the exact meaning can differ from phone to phone due to
different recording hardware and processing. If a sample is above the
trigger threshold set by the user, this is counted as an event and its
time is noted. The time is based on the sampling rate of the recording,
which is typically 48kHz (or in some cases 44.1kHz), resulting in a
theoretical temporal resolution of

Note that in practice this resolution is severely limited by differences
between the sounds from different bounces as well as dispersion and the
shape of the waveform itself and phyphox only displays three decimals
(1ms) while using the exact value internally.</p>
<p>The next sound samples will be discarded until a minimum time
interval set by “Minimum Delay” has passed. After this time the next
sample above the threshold is noted as the next event and the time
difference between subsequent events is shown as “Time 1”, “Time 2”,
etc.</p>
<p>Phyphox assumes a perfect parabolic trajectory between each event.
Therefore, “Height 1” to “Height 5” are simply calculated as</p>

<p>Note, that in practice, this usually underestimates the initial
height because the amount of energy transformed into heat on impact
typical increases with higher impact velocities. Therefore, the first
impact with the highest impact velocity usually has a higher “energy
loss” than the second, so by assuming it to be the same on both impacts
means that the energy before the first impact is typically
underestimated.</p>
<h2 id="problems-and-solutions">Problems and Solutions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phyphox misses some or all impacts.</strong> If the
measurement reacts to some impacts or loud noises like clapping, but
misses some impacts, the trigger threshold is set too high. Decrease the
threshold to match the volume of your impact sounds or increase the
volume of these sounds by picking a different ball/surface combination.
You can check also have a look at the volume of the sounds in the
phyphox configuration “Audio Scope”, which dislays noise in the same
zero to one range as the trigger setting.</li>
<li><strong>Events are registered even if the ball is not
bouncing</strong> In this case the threshold is set too low and/or the
background noise is too loud. Increase the threshold until the
measurement is not triggered by background noises. Make sure that the
bouncing sound is louder than the background noise in the room.</li>
<li><strong>Some bounces are counted as multiple events</strong> This
can be a consequence of a too low trigger threshold as the reverberation
of the sound is still above the threshold. Try increasing the threshold
first. If this is not an option because you are missing the quieter
later boucnes or because your surroundings are too loud, you can try to
increase the setting “Minimum delay”, which prevents fast events. Be
aware though, that this might also lead to missed events when the later
bounces occur more rapidly.</li>
<li><strong>The energy readings do not make any sense / Some energy
readings are larger than 100%</strong> Check the time intervals shown on
the heights tab. These probably are not correct and you might have a
very short interval in there from a bounce that was counted twice. Check
the solutions for missed collisions or collisions that have been counted
multiple times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>
<p>In principle, this experiment should work on various scales, from
marbles to basket balls and from centimeters to several meters. Just
keep in mind that air resistance might play a role and that vastly
different sound volumes or timing intervals can be a challenge.</p>
<p>Also, this experiment can be used in many different ways. It can be
used as a show-case for these calculations before and/or after
discussing the underlying calculations with students. It can also be
used to discuss collisions with varying elasticities. For this,
different combinations of balls and surfaces can be used to determine
the coefficient of restitution for each combination.</p>
<p>For a more systematic variation of the coefficient of restitution, a
well-bouncing ball (golf ball or steel ball) can be used on a hard
surface. Then the coefficient of restitution can be gradually lowered by
inserting an increasing number of sheets of paper between the ball and
the surface.</p>
